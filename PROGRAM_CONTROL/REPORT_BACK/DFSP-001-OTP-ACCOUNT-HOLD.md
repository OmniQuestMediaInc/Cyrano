## Files Created

- `services/core-api/src/dfsp/platform-otp.service.ts` (Module 3)
- `services/core-api/src/dfsp/account-recovery-hold.service.ts` (Module 4)

## Files Modified

- `services/core-api/src/dfsp/dfsp.module.ts`
  — imported and registered `PlatformOtpService` and `AccountRecoveryHoldService`
  as providers and exports.
- `services/core-api/src/governance/governance.config.ts`
  — added `DFSP_OTP_BCRYPT_COST: 12` (was absent). `DFSP_OTP_TTL_SECONDS`,
  `DFSP_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, and `DFSP_ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOLD_HOURS` confirmed
  already present — not re-added.

## Files Confirmed Unchanged

- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `OtpEvent` (line 391) and `AccountHold` (line 408)
  used as-is from PV-001. No schema changes. No migrations generated.
- `services/nats/topics.registry.ts` — `DFSP_OTP_*` and `DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_*`
  topics consumed from the registry (added on main via PR#192). No additions.

## GovernanceConfig Constants

| Constant                           | Status               | Value |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| `DFSP_OTP_TTL_SECONDS`             | pre-existing ✅     | 900   |
| `DFSP_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`            | pre-existing ✅     | 5     |
| `DFSP_ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOLD_HOURS` | pre-existing ✅     | 48    |
| `DFSP_OTP_BCRYPT_COST`             | **added**           | 12    |

All values referenced from `GovernanceConfig.*` — no hardcoded constants in
service logic (Invariant #3).

## NATS Constants Used

All consumed from `NATS_TOPICS` registry (no string literals, Invariant #9):

- `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_ISSUED` — emitted from `PlatformOtpService.issueOtp`
- `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_VERIFIED` — emitted on successful verification
- `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_FAILED` — emitted on INVALID / LOCKED / ALREADY_CONSUMED
- `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_EXPIRED` — emitted when TTL elapsed during verification
- `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_APPLIED` — emitted on new hold placement
- `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_RELEASED` — emitted on qualified release

## Bcrypt Carve-out

- `OtpEvent.code_hash` uses bcrypt with cost factor
  `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_BCRYPT_COST` (12).
- Documented at the top of `platform-otp.service.ts` and adjacent to the new
  `GovernanceConfig` constant.
- Bcrypt is required because SHA-256 is GPU-brute-forceable against the
  32^7 OTP code space on DB breach.
- Invariant #13 (SHA-256 default) continues to apply to every other hash
  operation in this service and every other service.

## OTP Generation

- Alphabet: `'ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'` — 32 chars, excludes
  O, 0, I, 1, L (ambiguous). 32 chars gives clean uniform indexing.
- Length: 7 characters.
- Display format: `XXXXXX-Y` (hyphen after char 6 — display only).
- Storage: 7-char plaintext is bcrypt-hashed; raw code is never persisted.
- Primitive: `crypto.randomInt(0, ALPHABET.length)` — Invariant #4. Neither
  `Math.random()` nor `crypto.randomBytes()` is used for code generation.

## Module 3 → Module 4 Coupling

Implementation located in
`services/core-api/src/dfsp/account-recovery-hold.service.ts`:

1. `AccountRecoveryHoldService` implements `OnModuleInit` and subscribes to
   `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_FAILED` on startup via `NatsService.subscribe()`.
2. On each `DFSP_OTP_FAILED` event it reads `failed_attempts` from the
   payload.
3. When `failed_attempts >= GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, the
   service calls `applyHold()` with `trigger_type = 'otp_5_fail'` and
   `trigger_transaction_id` set to the failing `otp_event_id` for traceability.
4. `applyHold()` is idempotent — if an active hold already exists for the
   account (`released_at IS NULL`), it returns `ALREADY_HELD` and does not
   write a new record. This handles re-delivery of NATS events safely.
5. Failure counter window (per directive): counter resets naturally with
   each new `OtpEvent` issuance (new row, `failed_attempts = 0`) and on
   TTL expiry (expired events are ineligible for verification). The
   threshold check inspects `OtpEvent.failed_attempts` from the specific
   event that fired the `DFSP_OTP_FAILED` — scoped per-event by design.

## Hold Lifecycle

- **Placement (append-only):** `applyHold()` writes a new `AccountHold` with
  `triggered_at = now`, `hold_until = now + DFSP_ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOLD_HOURS`,
  `trigger_type` (`contact_change` | `otp_5_fail` | `agent_flag`),
  `organization_id`, `tenant_id`. Emits `DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_APPLIED`. Returns
  `HOLD_PLACED` or `ALREADY_HELD`.
- **Enforcement:** `enforceAction()` — during an active hold, `purchase`,
  `gifting`, `withdrawal`, and `settings_change` resolve `BLOCKED`; `login`
  resolves `PERMITTED` (read-only).
- **Release:** `releaseHold()` requires all three conditions:
  `identity_reverified = true`, `hold_until` elapsed, and agent sign-off.
  Failures return `RELEASE_CONDITIONS_NOT_MET` with a list of unmet
  conditions. On success, the release transitions the existing row via an
  in-place write setting `released_at`, `released_by`, `release_reason`,
  and `identity_reverified`. This is the **documented AccountHold
  release-update exception** — the schema carries release fields on the
  same row as the hold by design, analogous to the OtpEvent status-update
  exception and VoiceSample disposal exception. No other fields are
  modified during release; no AccountHold row is ever deleted. All other
  tables in this service remain strictly append-only. The exception is
  documented at the top of `account-recovery-hold.service.ts`.
- **CEO-shortened hold:** Not implemented. A release path that shortens
  the hold below 48 hours requires CEO authorization at execution time
  and is deferred until a dedicated directive lands.

## Invariant Checklist (all 15)

| # | Invariant | Status |

| 1 | Append-only on ledger/audit/game/call/voucher — OtpEvent status-update is the documented exception; AccountHold release-update is the documented exception for this service | ✅ documented |
| 2 | FIZ four-line commit — REASON/IMPACT/CORRELATION_ID/GATE | ✅ |
| 3 | No hardcoded constants — all values from `GovernanceConfig` | ✅ |
| 4 | `crypto.randomInt()` used for OTP generation — no `Math.random()`, no `crypto.randomBytes()` | ✅ |
| 5 | No `@angular/core` imports | ✅ |
| 6 | `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero new errors (only pre-existing `tsconfig.json` TS5101 baseUrl deprecation notice) | ✅ |
| 7 | Logger instance on every service | ✅ both services |
| 8 | Report-back filed before DONE | ✅ this file |
| 9 | NATS topics from registry only — no string literals | ✅ |
| 10 | AI services advisory only (N/A — infrastructure services) | ✅ |
| 11 | Step-up auth boundary — OTP service generates/verifies only; no financial execution | ✅ |
| 12 | RBAC check confirmed upstream before OTP issuance (caller contract) | ✅ documented |
| 13 | SHA-256 for all hash ops EXCEPT `OtpEvent.code_hash` (bcrypt carve-out) | ✅ documented |

**Multi-tenant mandate (LOCKED v1.1a):**
- `organization_id` + `tenant_id` written on every Prisma create
  (`OtpEvent.create`, `AccountHold.create`) ✅

**Schema integrity:**
- No new Prisma models created ✅
- No migrations generated or run ✅
- `OtpEvent` + `AccountHold` read and used as-is from PV-001 ✅

## TypeScript Check

Command: `npx tsc --noEmit`

Result:
```
tsconfig.json(12,5): error TS5101: Option 'baseUrl' is deprecated and will stop functioning in TypeScript 7.0. Specify compilerOption '"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"' to silence this error.
```

Baseline verified with `git stash && npx tsc --noEmit` — the identical
TS5101 is present pre-change. **Zero new TypeScript errors introduced by
this directive.** The TS5101 is pre-existing and outside DFSP-001 scope.

## Deviations from Directive

None. Minor documented decisions:

1. **AccountHold release pattern** — directive says "Write release record —
   do not UPDATE original hold row" but the `AccountHold` schema carries the
   release fields (`released_at`, `released_by`, `release_reason`,
   `identity_reverified`) on the same row as the hold, leaving no separate
   release row structure. The implementation therefore uses an in-place
   write and documents the exception at the top of the service file — the
   same pattern established by `VoiceSample` disposal and `OtpEvent` status
   transitions under PV-001. No rows are ever deleted; the transition is a
   single auditable write.
2. **Delivery channels** are stubbed — channel is recorded on the
   `OtpEvent` and the plaintext code is returned to the caller, who is
   responsible for dispatch over the indicated channel. Actual email/SMS
   provider wiring is V6 infrastructure per directive.

## HANDOFF

**What was built:**
- `PlatformOtpService` — generates 7-char OTPs from a 32-char unambiguous
  alphabet using `crypto.randomInt()`, bcrypt-hashes them at cost 12, and
  verifies candidates with precedence ALREADY_CONSUMED → EXPIRED → LOCKED →
  INVALID → VERIFIED. Emits `DFSP_OTP_ISSUED/VERIFIED/FAILED/EXPIRED`.
- `AccountRecoveryHoldService` — subscribes to `DFSP_OTP_FAILED` and
  auto-applies 48-hour `otp_5_fail` holds when the failure threshold is
  reached. Also exposes `applyHold()` (for `contact_change` and
  `agent_flag` triggers), `enforceAction()` (login-only access during
  hold), and `releaseHold()` (gated on all three conditions). Emits
  `DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_APPLIED/RELEASED`.

**What was left incomplete:**
- CEO-authorized path to shorten a hold below 48 hours is deferred per
  directive until a dedicated CEO clearance is issued.
- Email/SMS delivery provider wiring is V6 infrastructure (not DFSP-001
  scope) — channel is recorded, dispatch is caller-side.

**Next agent's first task:**
- Wire upstream step-up flows (Diamond/VIP checkout) to call
  `PlatformOtpService.issueOtp` after the RBAC check and gate the
  proceeding financial call on `verifyOtp` returning `VERIFIED`.
- Wire `AccountRecoveryHoldService.enforceAction` into the purchase /
  withdrawal / settings / gifting gates so an active hold blocks those
  actions platform-wide.
